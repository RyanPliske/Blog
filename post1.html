	In my experience, I believe it's best to discuss your tools and blueprints before you start work on a construction project, because sometimes a hammer isn't the proper tool for screwing in a screw. The same goes for any software project.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A line of code is simply a command. Multiple lines of code <i>can</i> deliver an end result, but bad architecture, wrong tools or poor knowledge of your tools can land you in some deep water. Following GPS step by step directions is much like your program following instructional lines of code. Sure you might end up getting to your final destination, but you might end up doing backflips, getting completely wasted and end up streaking by the time you get there. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I started out making web applications in 2013 when I took "Database Applications and Information Systems" at the University of Missouri. The first week of class we had a web application due that very Friday. In a hurry, I was able to come up with a working web-app for that assignment without <i>truly</i> knowing what I was doing, whether my code was clean, efficient or even practical. This is a terrible way to develop software. Your application can easily become a house of cards. If something is overlooked, you could potentially ruin an existing structure costing your company millions or worse, cause disaster in a military programming setting.

	If you don't take the time to understand how everything works, you end up with crap software. As a software engineer, it's not only our job to understand the software tools we choose, but the hardware as well. Software engineering is <b>never</b> magic. There is <b>always</b> a reason and explanation for bugs, crashes and any oddities. In order to succesfully live in a muggle world free of magic, you need to reduce randomness as much as possible. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Unfortunately, in the web-application world we have  languages like PHP and JavaScript where randomness is their middle name. Developers have been manipulating JS and PHP to do things that they weren't initially meant to do. I've seen some web-apps that are frankenstein creations. Ya it's alive but, I mean c'mon. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There is an alternative life as a mobile or desktop developer. Step away from the dark side and use the force Luke. Yes I do still enjoy building web-applications, I just enjoy native software a whole lot more.

	P.S. If you're interested in understanding why I hate PHP and JavaScript so much, maybe take a look at some of these blogs (warning they are very technical): <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">PHP: a fractal of bad design</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">@eevee</a> or <a href="http://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-javascript-suck/" target="_blank">Why JavaScript Sucks</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/OhWhyDoesItSuck" target="_blank"> @OhWhyDoesItSuck</a>.
