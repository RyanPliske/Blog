	In my experience, I believe it's best to discuss your tools and blueprints before you start work on a construction project, because sometimes a hammer isn't the proper tool for screwing in a screw. The same goes for any software project.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A line of code is simply a command. Multiple lines of code <i>can</i> deliver an end result, but bad architecture, wrong tools or poor knowledge of your tools can land you in some deep water. Similarly, following Google Maps step by step directions is much like your program following your instructional lines of code. Sure you might end up getting to your final destination, but you might end up doing backflips, getting completely wasted and end up streaking by the time you get to your destination. Or you might not even get there and land in a river like Michael Scott did in the television series, "The Office." I know this now, but when I was just starting out I had no idea what I was doing.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I started out making web applications in 2013 when I took "Database Applications and Information Systems" at the University of Missouri. Without even knowing what HTML and PHP were, we had a web application due that very first Friday of classes. I was able to come up with a working web-app for that assignment without knowing what I was doing, whether my code was clean, efficient or even practical. If I had continued down this path, every application I built would have essentially become a house of cards. If something was overlooked, you could potentially ruin an existing structure. You could end up costing your company millions or worse, cause disaster if you're a programmer for the military.

	If you don't take the time to understand how everything works, you end up with crap software. As a software engineer, it's not only our job to understand the software tools we choose, but the hardware as well. In my experience, software engineering is <b>never</b> magic. There is <b>always</b> a reason and explanation for bugs, crashes and any oddities. In order to succesfully live in a muggle world free of magic, you need to reduce randomness as much as possible. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Unfortunately, in the web-application world we have  languages like PHP and JavaScript where randomness is their middle name. Developers have been manipulating JS and PHP to do things that they weren't initially meant to do. I've seen some web-apps that are frankenstein creations. Ya it's alive but, I mean c'mon. There is an alternative life as a mobile or desktop developer. Step away from the dark side and use the force Luke.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	If you don't understand why I hate PHP and JavaScript so much, maybe take a look at some of these blogs: <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">PHP: a fractal of bad design</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">@eevee</a> or <a href="http://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-javascript-suck/" target="_blank">Why JavaScript Sucks</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/OhWhyDoesItSuck" target="_blank"> @OhWhyDoesItSuck</a>. Yes I do still enjoy building web-applications, I just enjoy native software a whole lot more.
